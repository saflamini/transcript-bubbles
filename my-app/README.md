# Displaying Transcripts with Audio Files

1. Add your own audio file to the `/public` directory
2. Create a transcript, get the json response, and add it to the `./components` directory with the name `transcriptData.json`
3. Pass the path to your audio file as a prop to the `TranscriptBlock` component

## How it should look

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
